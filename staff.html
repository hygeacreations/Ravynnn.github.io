          Hello! I'm Ravynn and my pronouns are they/them. I wanted to set this server up to help people on their journey and
          I hope that one day we will expand more in the sense of server members and personalities of which the server gives out.
          Mundanely, I love to cook, learn about History (specifically The Rise of Power - Hitler) in the 1900s, and watch Shane Dawson.
          Magickally, I love writing spells, making elixirs + herb mixes, and working with the Moirai.
          If you ever want to speak about anything magickal or personal, my dms are always open :)

          I just turned 23 and I’ve been practicing witchcraft for approximately 3 years (give or take)
          but I’ve been unknowingly exposed to some of the practice my entire life. My great aunt has done tarot readings and read
          the family’s palms for as long as I can remember so I was always interested in divination. I’m an empath and psychic (clairvoyant and clairsentient),
          and occasionally I’ve been able to see spirits! My interests now mostly lie in astrology, alchemy, and herbalism (as far as the craft goes anyway).
          Aside from witchcraft, I (try to) live a vegan, zero-waste, natural lifestyle! I make all my household and skin/haircare products and try
          to invest only in the cleanest and most eco-friendly ways of living. :smile:
          Well that’s me in a nutshell, if you’d like to chat just lemme know, DMs should be open. :)

          Hi guys! I'm Snamorta and I've been interested in magic and the paranormal ever since I was 10, now that I'm 16, I'm planning to learn more and more about magic, and keep everyone safe. While I don't have much experience with magic, I'll grown with this community and continue to learn more. As of now, I've been learning about what things might mean in dreams, sigils, and crystals.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm not part of any religion as of now, but I have experienced Christianity a few years back. Plants are something I plan to work with, since it's subtle.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to DM me!

          Hi everyone, I'm Lynx and I'm a Guardian in the server. I'm 16 years old and my pronouns are she/her.
          I love requiring new knowledge, history and video games. I'm slightly experienced in witchcraft but there's always room
          to learn more and I hope I get to do that with everyone!
          <br>
          <br>
          I tell bad jokes. I have poor humour, I somehow always think I'm funny. I can quote Vines
          <br>
          <br>
          Feel free to chat with me or have a conversation in the voice chat channels, or DM me

          Hello there! You can call me Wish. I'm 17 and about to go into my first year of college for bioengineering.
          I've been actively practicing witchcraft for about two years now, but I've been interested in spiritual and supernatural
          elements of life for as long as I can remember! I'm not part of any religion, I prefer to carve my own path! Specifically I love tarot,
          crystals, spellwork, astrology, dreams, herbs, sigils, and much much more. Though I'm no expert I'm always open to talk with others about any witchy topic.
          <br>
          <br>
          Outside of witchcraft I love art (specifically digital drawing) and work on commissions often, write tons having to do with world building and writing my own book, and playing video games like Breath of the Wild. I'm always willing to talk about my characters, art, etc. I've been dating the love of my life for almost 6 years now and we're going to different colleges for the same major, hoping to live together right after college!
          <br><br>
          My Dms are always open to talk about anything!
